## buildspace.so 
buildspace, as it states on their site is a place "Where devs jump from web2 to web3." Very exciting to see they are an online learning platform that offers on the forfront of learning as we start *building the internet of tommorow. *

With an offering of 7 unique classes at the time of this righting, buildspace does an awesome job of giving us some variety in subject matter. Not only does it teach both front and back end for Web 3.0, it is also going to introduce you to a couple different blockchains. Thats right, not only will you be building on the Ethereum TestNet but you will also be working with the Solona and Avalance blockchains. Love the variety.

A much welcomed area of study is the JavaScript sections of the lessons. Awesome to see how a Web 2.0 language is still going to be as relevant and powerful in Web 3.0. React.js is used to create the front end for users to connect their MetaMask wallet to as they develop a blockchain based Twitter clone. 

You will get to know Farza along the way here and he will offer you encouragement and any help you may need. Farza is the owner of buildspace and he and his staff are reabibly available in the Discord chat for anything you may need such as Test Net ether or just general guidance. 

Ive been spending quite some time here and I am looking forward to claiming some of the NFT rewards for completing classes in a timely manner.  Cant't wait to see if they will be adding more content soon, but for now I have my schedule packed by going thru the offerings here thusfar.
